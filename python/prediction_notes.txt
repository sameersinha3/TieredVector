Temperature Prediction Notes - Jay
==================================

What I've done so far:

1. TemperaturePredictor class
   - Tracks document access history 
   - Updates temperature using same alpha=0.9 as simulate_temperature.py
   - Simple prediction based on access frequency (high access = temp goes up)
   - Identifies which docs should migrate between tiers

2. MigrationManager class  
   - Basic framework for moving docs between tiers
   - Tracks where each document is stored
   - Placeholder methods for actual tier operations
   - TODO: Need to integrate with actual Redis/LMDB/GCS

Key decisions:
- Using simple heuristics instead of ML for now (can upgrade later)
- Temperature prediction looks at access frequency over past 24 hours
- Migration triggered when predicted tier != current tier AND temp change > 0.15

Next steps:
- Hook up to actual storage backends
- Test with real query workload  
- Tune the prediction parameters
- Add more sophisticated prediction if needed

Test with: python test_prediction.py
